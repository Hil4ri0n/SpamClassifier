# Spam Classifier

## Description
The Spam Classifier project is a machine learning application designed to classify email messages as spam or not spam. 
This project utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and filter spam emails.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the email text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts text data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model using labeled email data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Spam Prediction**: Classifies new email messages as spam or not spam based on the trained model.
